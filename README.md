# Hi, I'm Todd Goates 🐐🐐

I'm a Full-Stack Developer from Utah

Here is some of the tech I like to work with:

- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript
- Vue
- React
- Angular
- Node
- PHP
- Laravel
- Docker
- AWS

I currently work for [Q90 Corporation](https://www.q90.com) as the VP of Development

To see some of my projects, check out my [repos](https://github.com/toddgoates?tab=repositories) or visit [toddgoates.com](https://toddgoates.com)

When I'm not coding, I like to spend time with my family, write stories, do yardwork, play Nintendo, go to concerts and movies, and spend time in the great outdoors
